I [write](https://twitter.com/rajgoesout){:target="\_blank"} about travel, tech, and navigating life as a 20 something.

<!-- My interests include writing copy, software, . -->

I've spent 4 years working in crypto, and more writing open source software; all remotely.

<!-- I work at [BUIDL Labs](https://buidllabs.io){:target="\_blank"},  -->

To dive into open source as a beginner, refer my [Playbook](https://rajgoesout.gumroad.com/l/gsoc){:target="\_blank"}.

To get started with blockchain development in 2024, follow my [Roadmap](https://rajgoesout.substack.com/p/blockchain-development-roadmap){:target="\_blank"}.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
