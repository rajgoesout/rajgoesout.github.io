<!-- I [write](https://twitter.com/rajgoesout){:target="\_blank"} about travel, tech, and navigating life as a 20 something. -->

I'm an independent researcher & full-stack engineer working in the web3 space.

My interests include DeFi, Blockchain Interoperability, ZK Proofs, Backend, and Protocol Engineering.

<!-- I've spent over 4 years working in crypto, and more writing open source software; all remotely. -->

<!-- I work at [BUIDL Labs](https://buidllabs.io){:target="\_blank"},  -->

<!-- To dive into open source as a beginner, refer my [Playbook](https://rajgoesout.gumroad.com/l/gsoc){:target="\_blank"}. -->
